## Requirements

- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net)
  - You're definitely going to need the game.

- [ComputerCraft: Tweaked](https://computercraft.cc)
  - This is a program for a CC: Tweaked computer, of course you need this.

## Features

- **Play Audio from YouTube**
  - You can search for videos by name or paste a url into the search field.

- **Create Playlists**
  - This is very barebones, but you can edit the playlists.json that ships with the program to add/remove songs from a playlist.
    - The "id" field in the expects a youtube video id (the section at the end of the url).
        - for example if you want this song in your playlist `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` you would put `dQw4w9WgXcQ` in the id field of the playlists.json.
